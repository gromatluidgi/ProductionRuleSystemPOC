## Concepts

### Expert System

As expert systems moved from research prototypes to deployed systems there was more focus on issues such as speed and robustness.

#### Knowledge Based System

A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to capture the **knowledge of human experts** to support **decision-making**. Examples of knowledge-based systems include expert systems, which are so called because of their reliance on human expertise.

#### Rule Based System

A classic example of a rule-based system is the domain-specific expert system that uses rules to make **deductions or choices**. For example, an expert system might help a doctor choose the correct diagnosis based on a cluster of symptoms, or select tactical moves to play a game.
